# Todo

Data collection:
- to decide number of images to take -> have to be uniform distribution i think (for diff classes)
- 7 classes: 10c, 20c, 50c, $1, $2, $5, $10

Data augmentation:
- can use script from previous project
- have to take into account bounding boxes

Labelling:
- Labelling -> can use [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)

Write out skeleton for obj detection algos
